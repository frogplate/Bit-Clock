# Bit-Clock

MicroPython binary clock for the BBC micro:bit.

It uses the top four rows of the micro:bit's LED array to display the time in binary. Each column represents one digit of the time in 24 hour format:

* Column 1 gives the first digit of the hours in binary
* Column 2 gives the second digit of the hours in binary
* Column 3 gives the first digit of the minutes in binary
* Column 4 gives the second digit of the minutes in binary

The time defaults to 12:34. Press button A to set the hours and button B to set the minutes.
